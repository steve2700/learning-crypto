## The Money-Making Mindset

### Stewart's Rule: Skills = Income

Every skill you learn should have a clear path to making money. Here's how to think:

**‚ùå Wrong Mindset:**
- "I'll learn Python for fun"
- "Maybe I'll use this someday"
- "Let me collect certificates"

**‚úÖ Money Mindset:**
- "I'll learn Python to build AI tools people will pay for"
- "This skill will get me freelance clients"
- "How can I monetize this in 30 days?"

### The Income-First Learning Method

1. **Find the money opportunity first**
2. **Learn the minimum skills needed**
3. **Build and sell immediately**
4. **Improve while earning**
